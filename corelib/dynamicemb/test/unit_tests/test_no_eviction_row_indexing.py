"""NO_EVICTION is the only score strategy whose value row differs from its hash
slot: rows come from a per-table auto-increment counter, and the key map is sized
``1 / max_load_factor`` times the value buffer. Addressing the value buffer with a
slot therefore reads the wrong row -- or past the end of the buffer entirely.

These tests drive the forward path over keys that are *already resident*, which is
what makes a lookup (rather than an insert) supply the index.
