"""Tests for what ProbabilisticAdmissionStrategy admits.

Admission is consulted only for a key that is missing, so one toss per
appearance is what makes a key's chance of being in the table rise with how
often it turns up. These check the distribution that produces, the two ends
where no arithmetic applies, and that a batch holding a key k times is the same
as k separate appearances.

    A key is admitted by drawing a uniform on [0, 1) and testing it against a

    -- their sum over N keys is Binomial(N, expected), and the fraction
    admitted has variance

        expected * (1 - expected) / N

    the Bernoulli variance divided by N, because dividing a sum by N divides
    its variance by N squared. Hence the square root below, and hence four
    times the keys only halving the window.

    Two limits on this. The normal tail SIGMAS is read against wants N * rate
    and N * (1 - rate) both above ~10, so a rate close to either end needs a
    coarser assertion instead. And it assumes one rate for every key: keys with
    different rates sum to a Poisson binomial, whose variance is the sum of the
    per-key ones rather than N times one of them.
