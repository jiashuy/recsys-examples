"""The input and output layout of a batched embedding lookup.

This is the single place the layout is written down. Everything else -- the
Python lookup path, the CUDA kernels, and the comments in both -- should refer
here rather than restate it. The device side mirrors the pooled half of this in
``src/pooled_layout.cuh``; keep the two in step.

The input and the output number the same bags differently
---------------------------------------------------------
A lookup covers ``F`` features over a batch of ``B`` samples, so it has ``F*B``
bags, each holding the keys of one (feature, sample) pair. The input and the
output disagree about how to number them, and keeping the two apart is what
this module exists for:

**input order** is feature-major, ``s = f*B + b``. This is how a
``KeyedJaggedTensor``, and therefore ``offsets``, lays bags out: all of feature
0's samples, then all of feature 1's. ``offsets`` has ``F*B + 1`` entries and
bag ``s`` owns ``values[offsets[s]:offsets[s+1]]``.

**output order** is batch-major, ``r = b*F + f``. This is how the pooled output
lays them out: one row per sample, features side by side within the row. Under
uniform dims the pooled output ``[B, total_D]`` is also a free ``[B*F, D]``
view, and ``r`` is the row index into that view.

The two are transposes of each other. Converting between them is what the
backward path does when it builds its gather ids, and it is the single most
error-prone step in the lookup -- go through the helpers below rather than
writing ``s / B`` or ``b * F`` by hand.

Worked example: ``F=2``, ``B=3``, both tables dim 2, so ``total_D = 4``::

    lengths, in input order:  [2, 0, 1,   1, 3, 2]
                               \\__f0__/  \\__f1__/
    offsets:                  [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9]      (F*B + 1 = 7 entries)

    input index s      0       1       2       3       4       5
    (feature, sample) (0,0)   (0,1)   (0,2)   (1,0)   (1,1)   (1,2)
    its keys          v[0:2]  v[2:2]  v[2:3]  v[3:4]  v[4:7]  v[7:9]
                              ^ an empty bag is normal

    output, [B=3, total_D=4] -- one row per sample:

                       cols 0:2   cols 2:4
                b=0  [    f0    |    f1    ]
                b=1  [    f0    |    f1    ]
                b=2  [    f0    |    f1    ]

    output index r     0       1       2       3       4       5
    (feature, sample) (0,0)   (1,0)   (0,1)   (1,1)   (0,2)   (1,2)

    Lining the two up by bag, every bag carries both numbers at once::

    (feature, sample) (0,0)   (0,1)   (0,2)   (1,0)   (1,1)   (1,2)
    input index s      0       1       2       3       4       5
    output index r     0       2       4       1       3       5

    Read a column, not a row: bag (0,1) -- feature 0 of sample 1 -- is entry 1
    of ``offsets`` but row 2 of the ``[B*F, D]`` view of the output. Only the
    first and last bag happen to get the same number in both orders.

Shapes
------
pooled (``SUM`` / ``MEAN``)   output ``[B, total_D]``; feature ``f`` occupies
                              columns ``[col_begin(f), col_begin(f) + col_width(f))``
sequence (``NONE``)           output ``[num_keys, D]``, one row per key, so
                              there is no pooling and no bag arithmetic at all

Dimensions
----------
``dims`` is per *table*; ``total_D`` sums over *features*, so a table shared by
several features contributes once per feature. ``max_D`` is the widest table.
``mixed_D`` means the tables do not all share a dim; only then is ``D_offsets``
materialized, and only then do the kernels need it to find a feature's columns.

The deduplicated embedding buffer the kernels gather from is always
``max(dims)`` wide, mixed dims or not -- that is the storage's row width, which
``Storage.max_embedding_dim()`` reports. A narrower table simply leaves
``[dim_t, max(dims))`` unused in its rows, and the kernels never read into the
hole because ``D_offsets`` tells them each feature's real width. Note that the
storage row is wider still: it is embedding ++ optimizer state, ``max_value_dim``
in total, which is why the source row stride is passed separately from the
copy width.

Invariants
----------
* ``offsets.numel() - 1 == F*B`` and ``offsets[0] == 0``. The backward path
  indexes a ``num_keys``-sized array with a raw ``offsets[s]``, so a non-zero
  base would write out of bounds.
* ``reverse_indices``, ``values`` and ``pooling_weights`` are aligned position
  by position: entry ``j`` of each describes the same key occurrence.
* Sequence mode requires a uniform dim, because its output is ``[N, D]`` with
  no per-feature column map to place a ragged row in.
